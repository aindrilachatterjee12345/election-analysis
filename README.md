Election Analysis 
# Challenge
In this exercise it is to confirm the voter turnout for each county.In this challenge it helped us to determine the number of votes that were cast from each county and the percentage of votes each county contributed to the election.For the analysis I have used 'for' loops and conditional statements to calculate the voter turnout for each county as well as the percentage of votes each county contributed to the election. Then, i determined which county had the largest turnout. So I have calculated the following:
Total Votes 
Votes and percent of votes. 
  #Winner of the election, winning vote count, and winning percentage
  #Each county’s total vote count. 
  #Each county’s percentage of the total votes. 
  #County with the largest number of voters. 
  I have saved the results to a text file and printed to the terminal. The code is running error free and I have added comments every statement for better understanding and also removed unwanted codes.
